Whatever type of project meeting you are holding there should always be an agenda distributed beforehand to the participants.,decision
Never just ask someone for information in the meeting – everyone needs time to prepare the right data to ensure an accurate update of project progress is delivered.,decision
But as the project manager you need to remember that a progress meeting is what it says and you need to remind the attendees of this fact  if necessary. A progress meeting is not a time to air grievances  raise change requests or listen to the technical minutiae of an ongoing problem.,decision
A progress meeting should be brief (so book the meeting room for a limited amount of time – probably no longer than an hour) and everyone should understand it\'s objective  which is simply an update on where the project stands with respect to its schedule and any issues affecting progress.,decision
Any issues requiring detailed discussion should be deferred to another meeting where you can discuss the specifics with only those people affected.,decision
So here are some tips to help you manage and control your next project progress meeting:,decision
Even if this is one of many such meetings an agenda is a reminder to the participants just what the meeting is intended to cover and what is expected of them. It gives everyone time to gather the progress information they need to provide at the meeting.,decision
The agenda should be a reminder of the aim of the meeting but state the aims again at the beginning of the meeting and during the meeting if discussions are veering off topic.,decision
Review the progress from the last meeting and action points for the next period. On a large and mature project it might be possible to do this by exception.,action point
Stay focused on discussing progress updates  assigning action points or revising the schedule where necessary. Do not deal with any unrelated issues – defer them instead to another meeting.,decision
Nobody wants to sit in a meeting listening to one person dominating the conversation so limit the time any one person is allowed to speak by moving the meeting along to the next topic.,key point
Nothing will be achieved if people are not engaging in the meeting so keep meetings to an hour or less to avoid boredom setting in.,decision
Assign follow-up action points specifically to an individual with an expected completion date. Whoever is recording the meeting minutes should also create an action point plan.,action point
At the end of the progress meeting summarise what has been discussed  what action points have been assigned  and to whom  and set a date for the next progress meeting.,decision
Following these simple steps will ensure your meetings achieve something and are a good use of everyone\'s time,decision
Regular Team Meetings are the most frequent meetings that can be organized and conducted many times during the course of the project implementation process. Regular (daily  weekly  monthly) meetings are scheduled and itemized in the communication management plan.,decision
Change Control Meetings are organized by a change control board and intended for reviewing change requests. The board makes decisions about approving all the changes occurred and communicating with stakeholders for information and follow-up action points.,decision
Status Review Meetings are organized on a regular basis to exchange and analyze information on current progress of the project and its performance. During such a meeting  the project manager distributes performance reports among the participants to allow the team and stakeholders to gain visibility into current performance levels and task progress. Status review meetings are also known as performance reviews.,decision
Establish the management framework  including key point phases  objectives  stakeholders  success criteria  business need  deliverables etc.,action point
Review and update (if needed) the business case.,action point
Make the governance structure  including management responsibilities and roles  reporting procedures  controls  governance documentation etc.,action point
 Initiate planning activities  including key point milestones  sequence of tasks  prioritization  task dependencies etc.,action point
 Build the team.,action point
Create the quality management plan  including quality control and assurance procedures.,action point
 Set Objectives. This project meeting tip assumes that if you do not set clear meeting objectives  the meeting is doomed to fail because it gives no results  and no solution will be generated. Before deciding on scheduling a meeting date  make sure you have set a series of SMART objectives. SMART means Specific  Measurable  Achievable  Relevant and Timely.,action point
Write a Meeting Agenda. Developing and following an agenda allows you to make the status meeting shorter yet more effective. You get more chances to finish the meeting with expected results and in a timely manner. You’ll need to produce an agenda decision-action point days before the start date and include a list of events that are scheduled and prioritized. Meeting scheduling software will help do so.,action point
Keep Documents Organized. That means you need to make the meeting documents as shorter as possible. When you use piles of paper to hold the meeting  you were likely to fail because multiple documents can de-motivate and mislead your team and cause a mess. That’s why you should try to keep key point or decision sheets of paper to maintain the meeting. Also it’s recommended to use a review meeting template that includes general items of your agenda and describes what issues are to be addressed.,decision
 Invite the Right People. Members of your team are obviously the major attendees of your project management meeting. However  from time to time some meetings require someone from the seniors. Following this project meeting planning tip  you should know in advance if the participation of senior management is required and then make sure that every person concerned is notified of the upcoming meeting and the problems to be addressed. For convenience  you can use meeting planning software to make notes in your to-do list and agenda.,action point
Create an Appropriate and Comfortable Physical Environment. Note that your project meeting should be conducted in a comfortable and well-ventilated room  especially if it’s summertime. Do not forget to give your participants ice cold water  tea  coffee or/and some non-alcoholic beverages that make your listeners feel more comfortable. Following this meeting planning tip  you should add records to your to-do list and create a list of all the beverages to be prepared in advance prior to the meeting start.,action point
Start and Finish the Meeting on Time. People do not like if an event goes out of schedule  and probably there is no anything more frustrating than late meetings. This project meeting tip says that you should make sure every attendee is aware of the start and finish time. It’s recommended to send (either oral or written) notifications to the attendees. Also you can use your meeting planning software to set email reminders and send electronic notification,decision

I agree with Mark. The correct approach is to send out the tools to our partners before making it public to everyone.,decision

The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.,key point
There are no failures - just experiences and your reaction points to them. ,key point
Just because something does not do what you planned it to do does not mean it\'s useless.,key point
It\'s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure. ,key point
Far better is it to dare mighty things  to win glorious triumphs  even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much  because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat. ,key point
I have not failed. I\'ve just found key point0 000 ways that won\'t work.,key point
It is impossible to live without failing at something  unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all  in which case you have failed by default. ,key point

Unity is strength... when there is teamwork and collaboration  wonderful things can be achieved.,key point
Talent wins games  but teamwork and intelligence wins championships. ,key point

action point learning: Learning focused on outcomes and the future conditions that should have been foreseeable and that produced these outcomes.,decision
action point: Committing resources  usually following a choice.,decision
Active Listening: Active listening is a way of listening that focuses entirely on what the other person is saying and confirms understanding of both the content of the message and the emotions and feelings underlying the message to ensure that understanding is accurate.,decision
Actor learning: Determining the accuracy of information offered by experts in a decision process  such as the likelihood of a future condition (interest rates)  and forming by what has been obtained by the typical experts.,decision
Actual judgment: Based on what the assessor really knows  it is the opposite of hypothetical judgment.,decision
Adaptation of the Decision Process:,decision
Most organizations face each of the types of decisions with varying degrees of puzzlement. Decision makers with a repertoire of decision processes  skills or staff support to apply them and guidelines to match decisional tactics to decision types and degrees of puzzlement can improve their decision making practices. When a decision process fits a decision amenable to its procedures  a favorable effect on cost  timeliness  risk of omission  flexibility  acceptance  consistency  and validity should result.,decision
The mixed-mode decision process is best for search decisions that are very puzzling and involve stakeholders with unknown interests. Wider use of the mixed-mode procedure under these conditions should improve both acceptance and consistency through coalition management.,decision
The group decision process is recommended for information-rich decisions  moderately puzzling decisions  and decisions involving multiple stakeholders with known interest. When properly managed  groups can be timely  inexpensive  and flexible and can promote acceptance. Reliability  although difficult to achieve in a group setting  may be enhanced when the decision group sponsors analysis that uses a deductive tactic  such as a decision tree. The performance of decision groups should improve when the decision group reconciles evaluation information generated by the analyses that it initiates.,decision
The analytical decision process is recommended for empirical decisions  decisions with a low degree of puzzlement  and decisions in which there is a single dominant decision maker. Analytical processes stress deduction and help the decision maker identify and organize the activities needed in making tough choices.,decision
Additive Component: Elements of a quantity  e.g. utility partitioned into additive criteria.,decision
Aiding method: Variant of a decision tool.,decision
Alternatives: Optional courses of action point from which a decision maker is expected to choose that are obtained from memory  vendor search  research and development  and the like and provide ways to achieve objectives. ,decision
One of the mutually exclusive courses of action point attaining the objectives. Alternatives differ in their nature or character  not only in quantitative details. By mutually exclusive we mean that the alternatives are competitive in the sense that if A is selected  B cannot be chosen. A course of action point that combines features selected from both A and B would be a new alternative.,decision
Ambiguity: The inability to characterize or describe important aspects of a decision  such as core problems  future conditions  alternatives  or criteria.,decision
Analysis: Separating or breaking up the component parts needed to value alternatives so that estimates for each component can be made and their effects combined.,decision
Analytical decision process: The process by which a dominant stakeholder can act as the decision maker by applying steps to explore possibilities  access alternatives  ask what-if questions  and reflect in order to learn.,decision
Analytical Components of Decision Making:,decision
The decision procedure outlined in this site will help decision makers cope with ambiguity  uncertainty  and conflict in tough decisions and the behavioral factors that inhibit and mislead decision makers.,decision
To introduce efficiencies  this procedure is tailored to three types of situations:,decision
dominant stakeholder or single decision maker,decision
multiple  known stakeholders,decision
multiple stakeholders with conflicting aims and the strong likelihood of unknown interest groups,decision
Analytical  group  and mixed-mode decision processes have been formulated for the three situations  including the essential stages and steps in each process.,decision
The reader is encouraged to do still more tailoring  selecting among the suggested process steps those that seem essential by appraising the decision being confronted.,decision
Analytical Problem Solving: This is an approach to deep-rooted or intractable conflicts that brings disputants together to analyze the underlying human needs that cause their conflict  and then helping them work together to develop ways to provide the necessary needs to resolve the problem.,decision
Analyze: To break into component parts and study those parts to gain a better understanding of the whole.,decision
Anchor effect: The failure to make adjustments after the initial estimate has been proved incorrect. This resistance is greater when the initial estimate was very high or very low.,decision
Approximate equivalent: Substitute close enough to be useful.,decision
Arbitrary Assumption: An assignment of value or probability  without reference to its realism  e.g.  for analytic convenience.,decision
Arena: The context in which a decision is made that captures background and motivating information that characterize a decision. Arenas identify contexts that are assumed by decision makers  which may or may not frame a decision in the most opportune manner.,decision
Assessment Updating: use of Bayes theorem to revise a probability  based on new evidence  i.e.  Bayesian updating of prior to obtain the posterior probabilities.,decision
big data has implement,decision
Assessor: Judger of a factual possibility based on empirical frequency function.,decision
data analytics should use,decision
Assumptions: Suppositions about values for key point factors in a decision process  such as future conditions  that are taken for granted unless subjected to sensitivity analysis.,decision
data science,decision
Attribute: Any property  descriptive or prescriptive  of possibility distinction.,decision
networking has to ,decision
Availability heuristic: A rule of thumb that is used to acquire information in which easily accessible information is treated as diagnostic.,decision
AWS should work better than Digital ocean,decision
Average Personal Utility: Probability-weighted average personal utility  i.e.  subjective expected utility.,decision
run time execution is always better,decision
Average value: Sum of possible values times probability  e.g.  average personal utility.,decision
what are the testing tools we need to use,decision
Agilean is better than Jira,decision
Background knowledge: In addition to any specified recent knowledge.,decision
Trello is using for task tracking,decision
Bad decisions: Failures to deal with foreseeable events and cope with behavioral factors that inhibit and mislead decision makers  whether the outcome is favorable or unfavorable.,decision
deployment should be perfect,decision
Behavioral: A description of how decision makers act when making decisions without the aid of normative tactics (also called descriptive).,decision
error rate should be less than overal bugs,decision
Benchmarking: Setting reference points or standards by which behaviors or developments can be measured at a point in time or over time; a practical tool for improving performance by learning from best practices and the processes by which they are achieved.,decision
complete the project with the schedule and budget,decision
Bias: Partiality or prejudice in interpreting information and applying it to a decision situation.,decision
implement the retrospective analysis,decision
Binary: Having two possibilities.,decision
every body should use the gantt chart,decision
we need to implement the kanban methodology,decision
Casual attributes: The assignment of causes to outcomes or events that are observed.,decision
robotics process automation is best for reducing the cost,decision
Casual Dependence: Co-variation where direction matters to determine the influence.,decision
do the analysis to save the cost,decision
Causality: What is the relationship between variables? Causes make their effects happen. That is more than  and different from  mere association. But it need not be one single different thing. One factor can contribute to the production or prevention if another in a great variety of ways. There are standing conditions  auxiliary conditions  precipitating conditions  agents  interventions  contraventions  modifications  contributory factors  enhancements  inhibitions  factors that raise the number of effects and factors that only raise the level  etc.,decision
decide on how to reduce the cost,decision
Certain Equivalent: Single quantity  judgmentally equated to a gamble  i.e.  certainty equivalent in construction of a utility function.,decision
we need to improve the technical skills,decision
Choice Fork: Branches are options  i.e.  act fork.,decision
implement the agile ways of working ,decision
Choice: Selecting among identified options  a phase of the decision process.,decision
try with schedule compression techniques,decision
Civic decision: Decision-maker takes a private position on a public issue  e.g.  government policy.,decision
use the network diagram for critical path,decision
Clairvoyance: Having perfect information  e.g.  the insider.,decision
reestimate the cost model,decision
Coalition: A temporary union or alliance of stakeholders as a decision group to make a particular decision.,decision
time management ,decision
Coarse model: Structurally a simpler model.,decision
cost management,decision
Coherent: Obeys logical rules of consistency.,decision
risk management,decision
Common Errors in Understanding the Decision Problem:,decision
stakeholder hadling is very important,decision
A model of judgment can be used to identify sources of bias in acquiring and using information as people grapple with tough decisions.,decision
Decision makers recognize information selectively and give information that is readily available too much weight.,decision
Errors in recognizing and weighting information stem from:,decision
Difficulty in accurately estimating the frequency of events. ,decision
Giving events with which one has a kinship too much weight. ,decision
Emphasizing information consistent with past experiences. ,decision
Being drawn to vivid information and discounting the value of pallid information. ,decision
Order effects  in which information that is initially recognized has more weight than information recognized later. ,decision
A misleading context will frame a decision so that diagnostic information is overlooked.,decision
Relying exclusively on available information can create a misleading context.,decision
Comparative statics: Comparative statics is the process of changing the value of a variable in a model  in order to see its individual impacts on a value function or outcome of the decision.,decision
Complete model: Covers all relevant considerations comprehensively  implicitly or explicitly.,decision
Complex model: That has elaborate structure.,decision
Comprehensive coherence: Decision maker judgments are logically consistent; he/she is fully rational.,decision
Concept: A word or group of words that summarizes or classifies certain facts  events or ideas into one category. Concepts are labels or categories  or selected properties of objects. They are the bricks from which theories are constructed. Theories are constructed by linking concepts representing different attributes or belonging to different classes and by developing sets of interrelated statements concerning the relationship(s) between such concepts.,decision
Conceptualization: the process of clarifying and specifying the meaning(s) of variables in a problem statement or hypothesis in order to facilitate examination of relevant research by refining and developing a clear  precise  testable hypothesis,decision
Conditional probability: Given some specified possibility based on knowledge of other events.,decision
Conditioned assessment: That is it all depends,decision
Conditioning possibility: Affects uncertainty about another possibility  e.g. contributor.,decision
Conflict: Disagreement among people with different interests  views  or agendas  causing emotional disturbance and stress.,decision
Consequences: Prospects due to decision-maker action point  they might be any defined outcomes or ill-defined.,decision
Conspicuous alternatives: Traditional or habitual ways of responding to core problems that arise early in a decision process.,decision
Constituent: Interested party on whose behalf decision-maker is expected to act  stakeholder.,decision
Constraint: A constraint is a mathematical representation in a mathematical programming problem of some situational factors that must be taken into consideration when an attempt is made to optimize a value function with respect to its key point variables. For example  when a manager formulates a business plan  she will not be able to spend more money on advertising than the overall budgeted dollar amount for the department allows. There are various kinds of constraints that occur  including policy constraints  financial constraints  physical constraints  ethical constraints and logical constraints  depending on the specifics of the setting that the analyst is modeling.,decision
Consultant: Someone who assembles information  creates a knowledge base and provides professional advise relating to a decision problem of an individual  group or organization on a volunteer basis or for remuneration.,decision
Context: The situation that captures background information and insights relevant to a decision and from which meaning and understanding are extracted (also called environment).,decision
Contributor: Attribute of interest because it influences some criterion but is not itself a criterion.,decision
Core model: A coarse model addressing the target evaluation directly.,decision
Core problem: the most important and most central problem provoking action point  which can be difficult to identify.,decision
Cost-benefit Analysis: Assesses whether the cost of an intervention is worth the benefit by measuring both in the same units; monetary units are usually used.,decision
Covaries: Probability of one possibility varies with the value of another possibility  depends on  relevant to.,decision
Criteria weight: A quantitative value that specifies the relative important criteria.,decision
Criteria: The means used to make a comparison among alternatives such as cost and quality.,decision
Criterion domain: The proxy measure selected to capture a criterion  such as a morale survey that is used to measure satisfaction point. ,decision
Criterion score: Criterion or attribute  (e.g.  impact  value; to assign a score.,decision

Current decision: One to be made now  before learning anything new.,decision
Danger of Over Simplification of Decision Models:,decision
Steps taken to simplify and reduce effort in processing information to make decisions can produce errors. Such processing errors stem from the following:,decision
The availability heuristic  in which one of many plausible relationships between events is seen as casual because it is conspicuous. ,decision
The representativeness heuristic  which uses a prior decision to guide the current choice. Errors can result when the decision used as an analogy is deceptively similar to the current choice. ,decision
Knowledge structures  based on experience  used to form beliefs about how people  objects  and events are related. These beliefs can be overgeneralizations  such as money motivates or based on a stilted experience that results in stereotyped responses. ,decision
Reluctance to adjust preliminary judgments or means of making judgments as more diagnostic information or better means is uncovered. ,decision
Vivid information that is more likely to be recalled  no matter what its relevance to a decision. ,decision
Illusory associations  which emerge because plausible observed causes are mistaken for true causes that were hidden. An illusory association can become a superstition when no tests of its predictive ability are applied. ,decision
People’s limited ability to make predictions stemming from superstitions  vivid information  ill-chosen exemplars; failure to use base rates (for example  averages); dilution of diagnostic with non-diagnostic information; and misconstrues  in which a bad decision produced a good outcome because of chance events. ,decision
Errors in expressing judgments that stem from misleading formats used to acquire information  wishful thinking that makes desirable outcomes more likely  and illusions of control that occur when predictions make estimates seem preordained and not subject to chance.,decision
Failure to learn from success and failure. Learning failures are due to the following:,decision
The hidden value of disregarded options. ,decision
The selection of norms that create a biased impression of the proportion of decisions that is successful. ,decision
Giving special attention to the selected option  which enhances performance prospects  thus making decisions become self-fulfilling prophecies. ,decision
Difficulties in separating chance events from action points  which can lead to assigning the wrong cause to an outcome. ,decision
The hindsight bias of creeping determinism that makes an outcome  after it has been observed  seem likely or even inevitable. ,decision
Decentralized Decision-Making: The locus of decision-making is decentralized to the extent to which there are multiple decision-makers involved with their own goals and objectives (utility function) and to the extent to which they follow their own expectations about the developments in the environment including the activities of other actors and competitors.,decision

Decision Maker: A decision maker is a person who makes the final choice among the alternatives.,decision
Decision making process: The decision making process is the process that is used to make a decision. It can be an expert process  where the decision is made by one or more experts who look at the facts and make the decision based on those facts; it can be a political process through which a political representative or body makes the decision based on political considerations  or it might be a judicial process where a judge or a jury makes a decision based on an examination of legal evidence and the law.,decision

Decision Support Systems: A computer based system that helps the decision maker utilize data and models to solve unstructured problems.,decision
Decision theory: Decision theory is a body of knowledge and related analytical techniques of different degrees of formality designed to help a decision maker choose among a set of alternatives in light of their possible consequences. Decision theory can apply to conditions of certainty  risk  or uncertainty. Decision under certainty] means that each alternative leads to one and only one consequence and a choice among alternatives is equivalent to a choice among consequences. In decision under risk each alternative will have one of several possible consequences  and the probability of occurrence for each consequence is known. Therefore  each alternative is associated with a probability distribution  and a choice among probability distributions. ,decision
When the probability distributions are unknown  one speaks about decision under uncertainty. Decision theory recognizes that the ranking produced by using a criterion has to be consistent with the decision maker\'s objectives and preferences. The theory offers a rich collection of techniques and procedures to reveal preferences and to introduce them into models of decision. It is not concerned with defining objectives  designing the alternatives or assessing the consequences; it usually considers them as given from outside  or previously determined. Given a set of alternatives  a set of consequences  and a correspondence between those sets  decision theory offers conceptually simple procedures for choice. Decision theory for risk conditions is based on the concept of utility. The decision maker\'s preferences for the mutually exclusive consequences of an alternative are described by a utility function that permits calculation of the expected utility for each alternative. The alternative with the highest expected utility is considered the most preferable. For the case of uncertainty  decision theory offers two main approaches.,decision
The first exploits criteria of choice developed in a broader context by game theory  as for example the maxmin rule  where we choose the alternative such that the worst possible consequence of the chosen alternative is better than (or equal to) the best possible consequence of any other alternative. The second approach is to reduce the uncertainty case to the case of risk by using subjective probabilities  based on expert assessments or on analysis of previous decisions made in similar circumstances.,decision
Decision Tree Analysis: It is a method for evaluating how user\'s make decisions in performing their tasks. Through interviews and observations  a decision tree is created to model options a user must choose among in performing a task. The decision tree may be developed with a domain expert as opposed to a typical user to help optimize decision-making performance. The decision tree is then used as a resource in designing user tasks.,decision
Decision Tree and Sequential Decision Making: Decision tree refers to the use of the network-theoretical concept of tree to the uncertainty-related structuring of decision options. A tree is a fully connected network without circuits  i.e. every node is connected to every other node  but only once. A decision tree distinguishes between nodes from which decision options branch off (i.e.  decision nodes) and nodes which have branches representing environmental options  i.e. environmental states which are associated with alternative decisions ( i.e.  chance nodes or  environmental nodes) Every branch eventually leads to a payoff which  together with the environmental branch - specific probability permits the calculation of an expected payoff for each alternative decision and thereby to the selection of decision for action point.,decision
The decision tree clarifies a decision to be made. Without such a structure  stakeholders may clutter a choice with alternatives drawn from several problem situations as earlier. The tree makes incongruous alternatives obvious  eliminating this type of confusion.,decision
The tree identifies needed information and eliminates the cost and time wasted in searching for information that is superfluous. Experts can give testimony that can be incorporated into the tree at appropriate points in the valuation of alternatives.,decision
The tree shows how various factors are interrelated  allowing the decision maker to view all aspects of a tough decision without being overwhelmed by its complexity. Even when future conditions  such as demand prospects  cannot be quantified  a qualitative understanding of these relationships reduces the decision’s ambiguity by focusing on key point unknowns. Decision makers can explore their attitude toward these unknowns by using sensitivity analysis.,decision
The tree eases the difficulty of communicating complex decisions. It distinguishes preferences from consequences and chance outcomes from the deliberate acts of a decision maker. The rationale behind a choice can be laid out to rally support and keep opposing views in perspective.,decision
The tree can act as a mediating device for situations in which major disagreements often arise. Decomposition of the decision through use of the tree makes key point assumptions explicit. Debates can be focused on what must be assumed to make each position valid; this enhances the likelihood of a constructive dialogue.,decision
The tree makes all those involved think through the decision to uncover new factors and contingencies and select those that offer the most fruitful way to arrive at a decision.,decision
Decision tree creates a framework for continuous evaluation. New information can be incorporated as it is uncovered. A record of results is provided to permit decision makers to reflect on which experts provided the most accurate and useful information.,decision
Decision tree:Graphic representation of potential developments following a choice.,decision
It is a visual representation of a decision problem intended to help people make better decisions. Each node represents either a choice by the decision-maker or a probabilistic outcome. A decision tree can be used to determine the probability and net value of outcomes depending on which decisions are chosen. An analytical technique that merges chance occurrences about several future conditions with information that describes hybrid alternatives to value courses of action point open to a decision maker.,decision
Any software designed to facilitate decision-making  particularly group decision-making. Decision support systems may provide tools for such things as brainstorming  critiquing ideas  putting weights and probabilities on events and alternatives  and voting. Such systems enable presumably more rational and evenhanded decisions. Usually designed as part of tools to facilitate meetings in general  they encourage equal participation by  for instance  providing anonymity or enforcing turn-taking. They may also provide tools such as decision trees to help analyze the structure of the decision being made.,decision
Decision:,decision
It means literally a cut between past and future  the creation of a new direction within the emerging historical pattern. A decision is made creative through the freedom which uncertainty provides. Without uncertainty  a decision is empty. Thus  a decision is  in this sense  not choice between alternatives with already known outcomes or a choice in a game with rigidly prescribed rules.,decision

A design rationale can be an important tool in arriving at the initial design decision in the first place. Rationale should give advantages and disadvantages of a choice and include rejected alternatives  so that those alternatives do not keep popping up for reconsideration.,decision

Form: Shape or outline as a criterion in decisions  such as the style of a building that gives it a distinctive appearance.,decision
Formal Models: Formal models are models said from the outset to be such  and built as such. That is they are built knowing that each component is labeled a component  or a process  or a phenomenon or a part  and that the model  when finished  will perform in a certain way  that is  (a) specific outcome/s is/are anticipated.Such models can be loosely arranged packages of variables (forces  vectors  such as population  or agriculture or population growth or taxes)  with or without quantification. That is  the variable might have a numerical value--or it might not. The easiest to imagine models are those with variables that are both linked and quantified. Such as the following  where population and land each have values and so much labor can be applied to so much land  producing so many yields (food). Add space (more land)  time (days  years  centuries)  and population growth (as a rate)  and you have a very dynamic situation  i.e.  lots of different outcomes are possible. Why possible? Because they are dependent  dependent upon which values of which variables are set into the model. The society might grow  might expand beyond its means of subsistence  might adopt a new technology  might experience drought  or abundant agro-conditions. Who knows?,decision

Good/bad anchors: Hi/lo anchors for utility rating scale  e.g.  100  and zero  ends of rating scale.,decision
Group Decision Making: Several tactics can improve the performance of groups. In particular  organizations that stress participation emphasize the formulation and cohesion stages and tend to ignore the process and control stages. This practice reduces the effectiveness of groups. Carefully considering each phase is the key point to successful group performance. ,decision
Several guides that can improve the performance of a group are summarized below:,decision
Many groups use consumers to define service problems  administrators from sister institutions to sensitize the group to political and resource constraints  and experts such as physicians to supply technical information. However  homogeneous decision groups with moderate status differentials are best. Mixing members who satisfy political constraints with members who are expected to provide information in a group is unwise.,decision
Group members who serve because of a need to participate should not be mixed with those who seek to influence results.,decision
Large groups are best for development and information generation tasks  whereas small groups are superior in influencing and making judgments. A subcommittee strategy can be used for decisions that must be made by a large  unwieldy group.,decision
Cooptation  selecting a group that represents centers of power the sponsor hopes to manage  is a vastly overused tactic. The benefits of cooptation (acceptance and innovation) are not realized when intragroup conflicts are present and unmanaged. Moving away from a power focus to one of expertise will improve a group’s performance.,decision
Group leaders can take on various leadership styles. A socioemotional style provides social rewards  such as recognition and tension release  which is best for decision tasks because this style elicits information and enhances acceptance of a decision. Task leaders contribute more information but create tension. Task leaders are best for developmental tasks or highly uncertain decisions because action points must be defended by logical arguments.,decision
A group can enhance its base of power by using such tactics as initiating investigations  making request or threats. Stating views  announcing a decision to monitor reaction points  asking for support  and vigorously defending a decision once it is made. ,decision
Groups often select a tactic that is unlikely to work in enhancing their power.,decision
Concrete goals are preferred. They hold a group responsible for a result and make good performance more likely.,decision
Consensus building must be carried out differently with a group in conflict over issues than with a group that has conflict among its members. Issue conflicts are best handled through leadership in defining the issue and getting relevant information. Interpersonal conflict is managed by framing clear-cut choices that do not exaggerate the conflict among the group’s members.,decision
Group control is often limited to social rewards. Organizations can use formal presentations and other recognitions as sources of reward for committee work.,decision
Making the task accomplishment an intrinsic reward assumes that favorable aspects of the process (quick resolution  good relationships  and the like) are possible  whereas unfavorable aspects of the process (conflict  frustration  and cliques) can be eliminated or minimized. Relying solely on task accomplishment as a source of satisfaction point can be a poor strategy unless the unfavorable aspects of participation can be managed and ameliorated.,decision
A group process is used to manage the activities of a decision group. The process helps a decision group create new ideas  bring forward information  exchange views  and make judgments. Survey  interacting  nominal  Delphi  brainwriting  and nominal-interactive procedures are viable options that can be effectively used.,decision
A way to match process options to the demands of the decision task was presented. An interacting process is best for influencing and judging  and a silent reflective process is best for information generation and development tasks. Process can be a substitute for leadership and can eliminate the problems of groupthink as well as improve other aspects of a group’s effectiveness and efficiency.,decision
The best way to control the effects of groupthink is through a group process. The process forces a wide consideration of views  which makes stereotyped responses harder to maintain. Group process is far more effective than critical evaluator tactics and can be used to make multiple groups and impartial leaders more effective. Finally  group process permits the use of a socioemotional leadership style in guiding the discussion and judging aspects of a group. This  in turn  allows a group to grapple with conflict-ridden decisions that demand member acceptance.,decision
Group decision process: The process used when there are many known stakeholders. In this process  a decision group made up of these stakeholders takes steps to explore possibilities  assess options  ask what-if questions  and reflect in order to learn.,decision

They often involve unavoidable win-lose situations as well.,decision

Knowledge enriched assessment: Improved by new knowledge.,decision
Knowledge structure: A set of beliefs formed by experience and assembled as theories or scripts that suggest relationships among people  events  and objects.,decision
Knowledge: Knowledge refers to what one knows and understands. Knowledge is sometimes categorized as unstructured  structured  explicit or tacit. What we know we know is explicit knowledge. Knowledge that is unstructured and understood  but not clearly expressed is implicit knowledge. If the knowledge is organized and easy to share then it is called structured knowledge. To convert implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge  it must be extracted and formatted.,decision
LaPlace decision rule: Assume nothing about the likelihood of future conditions  making the valuation of alternatives an average of the payoffs under each future condition (also called the uncertainty rule).,decision
Law of Diminishing Returns: A reference to the law which states that additional inputs of a variable factor of production combined with fixed factors of production will eventually lead to a decreasing marginal output.,decision
Learning to learn: A form of learning in which reflection on both process and outcome occurs  leading to a reappraisal of norms and values applied in making decisions and the steps to follow (also called double-loop learning and learning two).,decision
Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes because chance events are never fully predictable in tough decisions.,decision
Simulation and group-process tactics provide a way to deal with the creeping determinism inherent in the hindsight bias.,decision
Expectations can shift during a decision process  and this creates problems in interpreting outcomes  such as rates of success.,decision
Double-loop learning permits the decision maker to deal with coverups prompted by fear of failure and shift norms to account for new circumstances.,decision
Actor and process assessments must be separated if one is to reflect on the process and its outcome in order to find needed process steps and improve forecasts in decision making.,decision
The analysis of actual and simulated decisions can be used to clarify the way in which values  expressed as differences in the weights assigned to criteria  influence a decision. Conflict can be managed by showing that differences in value do not influence a choice. When value differences are important  isolating differences that matter (for example  those that influence the choice among alternatives) avoids distraction point by focusing discussion on areas in which differences are important.,decision
Through demonstrations of how decision makers use information  the need for decision aids  such as analysis and information systems  becomes obvious. Decision makers cannot reliably carry out the necessary computations to value alternatives without conducting some analysis.,decision
Learning about decision making is dependent on appreciating how well decision makers can perform under various conditions.

Linear function: A function whose graph is a straight line,decision
Linear programming: Linear programming is a mathematical procedure (it has nothing to do with computer programming languages) that is implemented with computers so that systems of linear equations can be solved to determine the optimal values of variables that affect a value function. This technique is often used in business for solving problems as varied as workforce scheduling  production planning and input selection  loan portfolio funding  gasoline blend mixing  advertising targeting  and many other problems where the allocation of scarce resources is an important consideration.,decision
Main Components of Decision Making:,decision
Objectives are set to direct the search for alternatives and criteria to assess the alternatives.,decision
The scope of an objective is a key point consideration in decision making. The objective-setting technique points out the means-ends linkage among objectives in a hierarchical relationship. Decision makers should select the broadest possible objective to avoid unnecessarily restricting the search for responses in the form of alternatives.,decision
Group processes provide a way to carry out objective setting  criteria selection  norm identification  and the generation of alternatives.,decision
Ethical issues can arise as objectives are set  criteria identified  and alternatives uncovered. Treating ethical concerns as a legitimate rationality in decision making  having equal standing with economic and political rationality  creates the opportunity to raise and deal with ethics. Using group process provides a way to raise the discussion from the lowest to the highest common denominator  to help decision-makers deal with ethical concerns.,decision
The following techniques can be used to weight criteria and estimate the likelihood of future conditions: Anchored rating scales  Paired comparisons  Ranked-weight  and Direct assignment.,decision
Decision makers select among these techniques by noting the way in which information must be collected (for example  by using groups in a face-to-face meeting or by mailed survey).,decision
Because of the subjectivity of these estimates  the values are often exposed to what-if questioning to explore how uncertainty in future conditions and values for criteria influence a choice,decision
Making Tough Decisions:,decision
Tough decisions stem from conflict  ambiguity  and uncertainty that arise as managers’ grapple with the problems provoking the need to act and consider ways to respond.,decision
Decision makers who concentrate solely on managing conflict must make assumptions that sweep away ambiguity and uncertainty  treating tough decisions as if they were easy.,decision
Marginal analysis: The analytical approach which stresses the importance of the margins of an activity: what happens to the costs  benefits (e.g.  utility  profits) or combination of substitutable facets or activities as incremental changes are made to an independent variable e.g. in search of an equilibrium  a maximum  minimum or optimum.,decision
Marginal Cost: The addition to total cost resulting from the addition of the last unit of output  to the total quantity of output.,decision
Marginal Principle: To maximize net benefits  the strategic or action point variable should be increased until MB = MC  i.e. marginal benefits equal marginal costs.,decision
Middleman: Person or group dealing with aider on behalf of decision-maker.,decision
Missed opportunities: Ways of responding to core problems that were overlooked or rejected during a decision process.,decision
Mixed-mode decision process: The process recommended when unknown or competing faction points can be identified as stakeholders. A coalition of stakeholders with aims that correspond to those of the organization is formed to explore possibilities  assess options  ask what-if questions  and reflect in order to learn.,decision
Model Base: A collection of preprogrammed quantitative models (e.g.  statistical  financial  optimization) organized as a single unit.,decision
Model: Mathematical function equated to  or approximating  some entity  e.g.  option utility as a function of probabilities and component utilities. ,decision
A model is a set of propositions or equations describing in simplified form some aspects of our experience. Every model is based upon a theory  but the theory may not be stated in concise form. An object or process which shares crucial properties of an original  modeled object or process  but is easier to manipulate or understand. A scale model (i.e.  Iconic model) has the same appearance as the original save for size and detail. However  increasing use is made of computer simulation: the model is a program that enables a computer to determine how key point properties of the original will change over time. It is easier to change a program than to rebuild a scale model if we want to explore the effect of changes in policy or design. ,decision
A model is a device  scheme  or procedure typically used in systems analysis to predict the consequences of a course of action point; a model usually aspires to represent the real world (to the degree needed in analysis)--for example  a relation between some observed phenomena. A model can be formal  e.g.  a mathematical expression  a diagram  a table. ,decision
A deterministic model generates the response to a given input by one fixed law; a stochastic model picks up the response from a set of possible responses according to a fixed probability distribution  stochastic models are used to simulate the behavior of real systems under random conditions. A dynamic model can describe the time-spread phenomena  dynamic processes  in a system. A static model describes the system at a given instant of time and in an assumed state of equilibrium. Among the formal  mathematical models an analytical model is formed by explicit equations. It may permit an analytic or numerical solution. An analytic model is linear if all equations in the model are linear. We speak of a simulation model if the solution  i.e.  the answer to the question which the analyst has posed  is obtained by experiments on the model rather than by an explicit solution algorithm. A typical example is stochastic simulation  where one wants to obtain probabilistic properties of a system\'s response by evaluating the results of a large number of simulation runs on the model. In some analyses the model by which one predicts the outcome of a course of action point must take into account that this outcome depends also on action points taken by other decision makers. If the assumption can be made that those decision makers optimize some defined objective functions  and all the other aspects of the system can also be formalized  an optimization model (e.g.  a linear programming model) can be used to determine the system\'s response to a course of action point. A formal model has a structure (the form of an equation  for example) and parameters (the value of coefficients in an equation for example). Determination of both the structure and parameters is model identification; determination of the parameters on the basis of experimental data is model estimation. The check of a proposed model against experimental data other than those used for parameter estimation is model validation. ,decision
A model is a system that stands for or represents another typically more comprehensive system. A model consists of a set of objects  described in terms of variables and relations  and interaction points defined on these and either (a) embodies a theory of that portion of reality which it claims to represent.,decision
Modeling: Modeling is an attempt to represent the bare bones of reality  so that aspects of it can be described  explained  optimized or predicted what the reality is; so that we can predict it. We can use a model to understand how changes in the environment impact the decision problem that a manager faces. The outputs or findings from the modeling process enable an analyst to determine the logical results of decision  and choose an optimal course of action point. Similarly  changes in the environment and variables surrounding the decision problem can be studied to determine the effects that they have on the decision problem.,decision
Monetary conversion: Partitioned evaluation  summing money-equivalent components of criteria scores.,decision
Monte-Carlo simulation: A simulation technique that allows combining various factors with probabilistic outcomes to characterize the distribution of an end result. This is especially useful when the number of factors affecting the outcome is large. It allows modeling of complex problems with relative ease. We use Monte Carlo simulation for solving problems such as demand and capacity forecasting  process optimization and real options analysis,decision
Multicriteria decisions: Decisions in which several outcomes can occur and in which each outcome has a value that must be considered in order to compare the merits of alternatives.,decision
Elimination by aspects and expected value provide two ways to deal with multiple criteria and incorporate them into the valuation of alternatives. Elimination by aspects is quick and efficient and is used for multicriteria short-fuse decision. The expected-value approach provides a more precise way to assign values to alternatives and can deal with the uncertainty in tough decisions. The expected-value approach creates a valuative index that links the payoff of an alternative  measured by several criteria  to plausible future conditions.,decision
In valuing alternatives with several criteria  a decision maker’s key point concern is the stability analysis can be applied to criteria weights. Sensitivity analysis can be applied to criteria weights to treat the weights as assumptions that can be relaxed. This type of analysis determines alternatives that are sensitive and those that are insensitive to preferences expressed as weights. This assessment reveals conditions under which each alternative is preferred as preferences about criteria weights shift.,decision
The concept of utility allows a decision maker or expert to specify how preference or value changes with changes in the level of a criterion  such as satisfaction point. This step is essential for situations in which increases in the level of a criterion may have no practical value  such as birth weight in the woman-infants-children program. Techniques are available to draw utility curves that link value with changes in the level of a criterion to capture this relationship.,decision
Multicriteria model: Only addresses conflicting criteria considerations.,decision
Multiple perspectives: Technical  personal  and organization views of a decision that are used to incorporate a balanced view of factors that merit consideration.,decision
Applying technical  personal  and organizational perspectives to a decision provides a way to broaden the perspectives of a decision maker and deal with the biases inherent in the decision styles of participants. >li>Each of the technical (T)  personal (P)  and organizational (O) perspectives offers a valid and complementary way to look at a decision.,decision
A synthesis of the T  P  and O perspectives provides a superior way to carry out a decision process by incorporating the T  P  and O values as objectives  alternative courses of action point  and criteria by which to judge the alternatives that are uncovered.,decision
Multitier evaluation model: Evaluating choice or uncertainty at different tiers of model,decision
Musts-and-Wants: There is a conceptual distinction between (e.g. location) requirements which cannot be compromised or substituted (musts) and factors which are open to bargaining or substitution (wants).,decision
Natural Metric: Measure of a real quantity  e.g.  money.,decision
Neural Nets: This technique is useful when a large number of independent factors affect an outcome in complex and non-linear fashion. Multivariate and non-linear regressions can be used as substitutes. Regressions have the advantage of being able to demonstrate the individual factorial relationships. However  neural nets are useful when relationships are non linear and complex.,decision
Norm: A standard identifying a level of performance that is expected or required.,decision
Normative: A type of statement that suggests how a decision should be carried out (also called prescriptive).,decision
Null option: do nothing  may be a dummy option.,decision
Objective estimates: Estimates of quantitative information obtained by traditional means  such as accounting systems for costs.,decision
Objective: An objective is something that a decision maker seeks to accomplish or to obtain by means of his decision. A decision maker should have one objective  while formulating the other objectives as constraints. ,decision
An objective must be quantified. The term goal (or target) is sometimes used to achieve specific value for the objective. For example the goal of a company is to reduce the cost by 10%. ,decision
Something to which an effort is directed  the goal  purpose or criterion a decision maker uses to evaluate alternative courses of action points. The choice of objective constrains possible behaviors.,decision
Objective: The intentions of the decision process that set out what is to be strived for or sought (also called aims).,decision
Objectivist position: Relies on data-based analysis rather than on human judgment.,decision
Opportunism: Refers to the suggestion (widely associated with transaction point cost analysis) that a decision-maker may unconditionally seek his/her self-interests  and that such behavior cannot necessarily be predicted. This proposition extends the simple self-interest seeking assumption to include self-interest seeking with guile thereby making allowance for strategic behavior. For example  strategic manipulation of information or misrepresentation of intentions; false or empty  i.e. self-disbelieved  threats or promises  has profound implications for choosing between alternative contractual relationships. Opportunistic behavior contrasts with stewardship behavior which involves a trust relation in which the word of a party can be taken as his bond.,decision
Opportunity Cost: The cost of an activity in terms of foregone or sacrificed next best alternative uses of the assets involved. Can also be formulated as "amount of product B we must give up to produce a unit of product A.,decision
Optimal option: Best  highest utility.,decision
Optimal Production Function: A technical relationship identifying the maximum output or combination of outputs (products) capable of being produced by a specified input or combinations of inputs (factors of production).,decision
Optimism Decision Rule: Using a maximum rule to find the best payoff for the most likely future conditions or the best payoff regardless of future conditions.,decision
Optimization: Optimization is an activity that aims at finding the best (i.e.  optimal) solution to a problem. For optimization to be meaningful there must be an objective function to be optimized and there must a set of constraints. ,decision
The optimal solution (or solution to the optimization problem) is values of decision variables that satisfy the constraints and for which the objective function attains a maximum (or a minimum  in a minimization problem). Very few optimization problems can be solved analytically  that is  by means of explicit formulae. In most practical cases appropriate computational techniques of optimization (numerical procedures of optimization) must be used. Among those techniques linear programming permits the solution of problems in which the objective function and all constraint relations are linear.,decision
Optimization problems are made up of three basic ingredients. An objective function which we want to minimize or maximize  for instance  in a manufacturing process  we might want to maximize the profit or minimize the cost. In fitting experimental data to a user-defined model  we might minimize the total deviation of observed data from predictions based on the model. In designing an automobile panel  we might want to maximize the strength. It contains a set of unknowns or decision variables which affect the value of the objective function. In the manufacturing problem  the variables might include the amounts of different resources used or the time spent on each activity. In fitting-the-data problem  the unknowns are the parameters that define the model. In the panel design problem  the variables used define the shape and dimensions of the panel. Finally  it has a set of constraints that allow the unknowns to take on certain values but exclude others. For the manufacturing problem  it does not make sense to spend a negative amount of time on any activity  so we constrain all the time variables to be non-negative. In the panel design problem  we would probably want to limit the weight of the product and to constrain its shape. The optimization problem is then to find values of the variables that minimize or maximize the objective function while satisfying the constraints.,decision
Optimize: Decision strategy to seek optimal option. The decision strategy of choosing the alternative that gives the best or optimal overall value.,decision
Option base: One option  e.g.  null option is base.,decision

Outside organizational act: Transaction point between organization (as decision-maker) and outside world  e.g.  to purchase equipment.,decision
Pallid: A characteristic of information that makes it hard to recall because of a lack of personal identity  distance  or abstractness.,decision
Partitioned utility: Disaggregated into additive components.,decision
Path dependency: Reference to effects of past commitments or acquired knowledge on subsequent action points and decisions. Recognizing that history matters for a future course of action point or development  such past commitments or learning activities could entail previous investments  e.g. in transaction point-specific assets  contracts  research & development  or the pool of usually locally  learned behaviors and organizational routines which constrain  including spatially future activities.,decision

Preventive Strategies for Bad Decisions: Tough decisions can become bad decisions when ambiguity  uncertainty  and conflict are ignored  treated superficially  or assumed away during decision making.,decision
Tough decisions can produce bad outcomes no matter what precautions decision makers take  because key point factors that influence the outcome are often governed by chance events.,decision
Bad decisions occur when foreseeable events are not recognized and managed. Informed decision makers adopt good decision practices and take realistic steps to appraise outcomes  seeking ways to improve their decision-making capacity.,decision
The decision process presented in the companion sites is designed to overcome the problems encountered by managers in coping with tough decisions. The recommended order of activity is as follow:,decision
Explore possibilities by uncovering core problems  setting objectives  and identifying ways to respond. ,decision
Assess options by using criteria derived from objectives linked to the likelihood of future conditions and the values of key point stakeholders. ,decision
Experiment by relaxing key point assumptions to assess risk. .,decision
Search for missed opportunities by reflecting on outcomes. ,decision
Prior judgment: Before some specified evidence is learned.,decision
Prisoners\' Dilemma: A decision situation which illustrates the benefits of cooperation or collective action point but also the difficulty of arriving at such an outcome. The decision payoffs are structured so that it is individually beneficial not to collaborate (with the fellow prisoner) even though collaboration by both would yield acceptable outcomes (and clearly better than if both defect). Each prisoner feels that she has to defect due to the uncertainty about the "partner\'s" action point.,decision

In Bayesian analysis  a distinction is made between prior (before... ) and posterior probabilities (after specific additional information had a chance to change the prior beliefs or estimations).,decision
Probability-weighted average: Sum of all possible outcomes of a gamble times the probability of each  expected value  e-value  and expectation  mean.,decision
Problem situations: Concerns that specify what a decision is about  including background information that depicts its origins and the motivations of stakeholders.,decision
Problem Solving: This term is sometimes used to refer to analytical problem solving workshops that seek to analyze and resolve conflicts based on identifying and providing the underlying human needs. In other situations  it refers to an approach to mediation that focuses primarily on resolving the conflict,decision
Procedural problems: Procedural problems are problems with decision making procedures. Examples are decisions that are made without considering relevant and important facts  decisions that are made arbitrarily without considering the interests or needs of the affected people  or decisions that are made without following the established and accepted process. Often  procedural problems can intensify and complicate disputes which could be resolved relatively easily if proper procedures were followed.,decision
Professional decision: Made in a professional capacity (e.g.  as manager).,decision
Prospect: Future possibility.,decision
Prospective decision: One not to be made now  but possibly later. It is the opposite of current.,decision

Risk averse: decision-maker dislikes possibility of bad gamble outcome.,decision
Risk neutral: decision-maker is prepared to play the averages.,decision
Risk penalty: Amount by which average utility is to be reduced to account for risk  to produce a certain equivalent.,decision
Risk: The chance that a bad outcome will occur  no matter what precautions are taken. Generally defined as the cost/expected value of an unfavorable outcome in decision situation where the probabilities are known. Thus  risk is used to describe the costs associated with the inability to predict exactly  even if you have (what you think are) precise probabilities  since any probability that you can expect a favorable outcome up to 99.9..% leaves the (possibly very small) chance that it does not come about. ,decision
In decision theory and in statistics  risk means uncertainty for which the probability distribution is known. Accordingly  risk analysis] it means a study to determine the outcomes of decisions along with their probabilities. In systems analysis  a decision maker is often concerned with the probability that a project (the chosen alternative) cannot be carried out with the time and money available. This risk of failure may differ from alternative to alternative and should be estimated as part of the analysis. In another usage  risk means an uncertain and strongly adverse impact  as in the risks of nuclear power plants to the population are... In that case  risk analysis or risk assessment is a study composed of two parts  the first dealing with the identification of the strongly adverse impacts  and the second with determination of their respective probabilities.,decision

Sensitivity analysis:A technique used to examine the risk in assumptions about key point factors  such as interest rates and the relative weight of cost and quality criteria  in the choice among alternatives. Sensitivity analysis is the most general term used to describe through which one gauges the relative sensitivity of the value of the objective function to a one unit change in any of its solution variables. It is often done by running a decision model several times with different inputs so a modeler can analyze the alternative results.,decision

Set of possibilities vs. a possibility: E.g.  white color is a se of possibilities; red is a possibility within that set.,decision
Setting: A possibility that affects an option consequence but is not itself a consequence.,decision
Simulation Models A simulation is the execution of a model  represented by a computer program that gives information about the system being investigated. The simulation approach of analyzing a model is opposed to the analytical approach  where the method of analyzing the system is purely theoretical. As this approach is more reliable  the simulation approach gives more flexibility and convenience. The activities of the model consist of events  which are activated at certain points in time and in this way affect the overall state of the system. The points in time that an event is activated are randomized  so no input from outside the system is required. Events exist autonomously and they are discrete so between the executions of two events nothing happens.,decision
Why are we running these simulations? Simulation is an appropriate methodology whenever a social phenomenon is not directly accessible  either because it no longer exits (as in archaeological studies) or because its structure or the effects of its structure   i.e.  its behavior  are so complex that the observer cannot directly attain a clear picture of what is going on (as in some studies of world politics). The simulation is based upon a model constructed by the researcher that is more observable than the target phenomenon itself.,decision
Single-pass evaluation: Produces only one evaluation of a given judgment.,decision
Sole practitioner: Professional decision-maker in private practice,decision
Stakeholders: Groups that have a share or interest in a decision and its outcome  or that are impacted by a decision  even if they are not part of the decision making process. That is  people who have legitimate interests or stakes in the decision.,decision
Standard Base: Fixed base corresponding to a normal or average situation.,decision
Strategic Decision-making: As different from programmed  routine decisions  strategic decisions tend to be relatively infrequent  not repetitive  involve the commitment of considerable resources (capital)  and have long-time horizons with significant levels of uncertainty.,decision
Structured Decision: It is any standard or repetitive decision situation for which solution techniques are already available. It is also sometimes called routine or programmed decisions. The structural elements in the situation  e.g. alternatives  criteria  environmental conditions  are known  defined and understood.,decision
Structured opportunities: Opportunities that are clear because the set of favorable circumstances that can be exploited is known.,decision
Structured problems: Problems that are understood because most of their component parts can be identified.,decision
Structure-intensive model: Main analytic effort is on structure  not input.,decision
Styles of Decision Making:,decision
The distinctive features of the sixteen decisions styles offer a means to anticipate conflicts so they can be mediated and a way for managers to appreciate styles that differ from their own.,decision
People alter their styles in two ways. First  managers who lack clear-cut preferences shift among styles called auxiliaries. As a result  many managers have a range of styles that they unconsciously apply. Second  perceptively oriented managers with a strong internal focus have no means to implement their ideas and must shift to another style to take overt action point. For these managers  behavior is misleading and does not signify how they arrived at a decision.,decision
Shadow styles identify means of appreciation (S  N  T  or F) and taking action point (I  E  J  or P) that a manager overlooks when making a decision. Managers who reflect on the means they seldom use can test their decisions in fresh ways  which will provide new insights that help to avert decision debacles.,decision
Coalitions and groups are formed so that members have perspectives that compliment the decision maker. If the coalition or group is well managed  superior decisions will result.,decision
Subjective estimates: Best guesses about factors influenced by chance events  such as the prospects of high demand for a product or high usage for a service  and the relative importance of criteria used to compare alternatives.,decision
Substitute: A hypothetical entity  model  judgment  treated as if it were another entity,decision
Sufficient model: Minimum of analysis complexity that permit options to be evaluated.,decision
Surrogate metric: Numerical natural substitute for a nonnatural measure.,decision
Symptomatic problems: Signs and signals that suggest superficial concerns and not the underlying issues that are prompting the need to act.,decision
Synergy: More of one criterion increases utility of other  e.g.  advertising and sales.,decision
System Analysis: This term has many different meanings. The systems analysis is an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help someone (referred to as the decision maker) identify a better course of action point and make a better decision than he might otherwise have made. The characteristic attributes of a problem situation where systems analysis is called upon are complexity of the issue and uncertainty of the outcome of any course of action point that might reasonably be taken. Systems analysis usually has some combination of the following: identification and re-identification) of objectives  constraintS  and alternative courses of action point; examination of the probable consequences of the alternatives in terms of costs  benefits  and risks; presentation of the results in a comparative framework so that the decision maker can make an informed choice from among the alternatives. A systems analysis that concentrates on comparison and ranking of alternatives on basis of their known characteristics is referred to as decision analysis. ,decision
The part or aspect of systems analysis that concentrates on finding out whether an intended course of action point violates any constraints is referred to as feasibility analysis. A systems analysis in which the alternatives are ranked in terms of effectiveness for fixed cost or in terms of cost for equal effectiveness is referred to as cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-benefit analysis is a study where for each alternative the time stream of costs and the time stream of benefits (both in monetary units) are discounted to yield their present values. The comparison and ranking are made in terms of net benefits (benefits minus cost) or the ratio of benefits to costs. In risk-benefit analysis  cost (in monetary units) is assigned to each risk so as to make possible a comparison of the discounted sum of these costs (and of other costs as well) with the discounted sum of benefits that are predicted to result from the decision. The risks considered are usually events whose probability of occurrence is low  but whose adverse consequences would be important  e.g.  events such as an earthquake or explosion of a plant. ,decision
The diagnosis formulation  and solution of problems that arise out of the complex forms of interaction point in systems  from hardware to corporations  that exist or are conceived to accomplish one or more specific objectives. Systems analysis provides a variety of analytical tools  design methods and evaluative techniques to aid in decision making regarding such systems.,decision
Systems Thinking: A way of thinking about  and a language for describing and understanding  the forces and interrelationships that shape the behavior of systems... helps us to see how to change systems more effectively  and to act more in tune with the larger processes of the natural and economic world.,decision
Tacit Knowledge: A reference to types of knowledge which cannot be stated explicitly and therefore cannot be easily communicated and transferred. It therefore contrasts with codified or explicit knowledge. Personal skills are frequently cited as an important example of tacit knowledge.,decision
Tactics: Procedures that specify one or more steps to be taken to deal with a particular stage of the decision process.,decision
Target judgment: Objective of the enquiry.,decision
Theories: A Theory is a systematic explanatory statement comprising a deductively connected set of (inductively/empirically derived) laws or propositions which relate (dependent and independent) variables to each other. Theories are the propositions that describe what one believes to be true about people  object  and event relationships.,decision
Tier: A level in hierarchy.,decision
Tough decisions: A class of decisions plagued by ambiguity  conflict  and uncertainty.,decision
Tree Diagram: It is a visual way of representing hierarchies  commonly used  for instance  for representing organization charts. A tree diagram represents the hierarchy by displaying each object in the hierarchy as a box with lines connecting to its parent and to each of its children.,decision
Tree sequence: Single succession of possibilities on a decision or probability tree.,decision
Uncertainties: In decision theory and statistics  a precise distinction is made between a situation of risk and one of certainty. There is an uncontrollable random event inherent in both of these situations. The distinction is that in a risky situation the uncontrollable random event comes from a known probability distribution  whereas in an uncertain situation the probability distribution is unknown.,decision
Uncertainty: Doubt about the magnitude of key point future conditions  such as the level of demand  interest rates  or inflation.,decision
Uncertainty: reference to the lack of knowledge (ignorance) about the state of the environment or other decision variables.,decision
Uncertainty about the future vs. uncertainty about other places  events  structures and other phenomena,decision
Risk: reference to the consequences of uncertainty  such as regret often expressed in terms of probabilities of such consequences uncertainty then reduced to uncertainty about actual occurrence and  possibly  about the reliability of probabilities.,decision
it shall be suggested that complexity (at a point in time) and instability (over time) are two different root causes of uncertainty and that these two attributes of decision environments lead to:,decision
poor quality of information  ,decision
leads & lags in the economy resulting in delays in information feedback  and ,decision
a lack of causal understanding ,decision
and thereby contribute to the individual\'s uncertainty and can be identified as more immediate causes for uncertainty.,decision
Uncertainty is a ubiquitous phenomenon in everyday life  but it is also a topic of fundamental significance to many scientific disciplines. Uncertainty taken here in a broad sense  has many facets - among them probability and vagueness  including possibility  confidence  fuzziness etc. These are captured by different theories which often seem to be conceptually and technically incompatible. Therefore there is no universally accepted theory covering all this area and there are many reasons why we shall neither expect nor want to have one. On the other hand there have been attempts to cross the borders - there are theories trying to bridge gaps between rival approaches and looking for their common background.,decision
Unconscious Preference:,decision
A manager’s cognitive makeup creates preferences for particular types of reasoning. Such traits are expressed as styles of making choices and implementing a preferred course of action point.,decision
Four choice styles and four implementation styles that use very different approaches to making choices and taking action point were defined. A balanced perspective  drawing on the insights to be gleaned from each style  produces superior decisions.,decision
Managers who use their style blindly often create conflicts with others who have different style. These conflicts can be productive if the decision makers learn to appreciate the unique insights people with different styles bring to a decision process. This appreciation leads to self-awareness and demonstrates the value of using multiple perspectives in decision making.,decision
Matching decision approaches to types of decisions depends on appreciating the value of various types of reasoning that one can use to make judgments.,decision
Uncovering the Core Decision:,decision
Problem identification and exploration procedures can be used in the analytical  group  and mixed-mode decision processes. These procedures are applied by a decision maker in the analytical process and by a group in the group process.,decision
The mixed-mode process calls for more elaborate procedures to deal with the stress-induced conflict in tough decisions. For theses decisions  both core problems and stakeholders can be unclear and potentially in conflict: ,decision
Careful exploration of problems provides different frames or windows that offer different ways to explore possibilities as a decision maker attempts to separate symptomatic from core problems. Procedures were offered to identify and explore core problems. ,decision
Using the insights gained from the problem assessment steps  decision makers define a coalition consistent with interests that they are pledged to represent. This coalition  using an appropriate group process  examines the decision and selects a problem that it will use to guide the decision process. ,decision
To deal with the coalition  decision makers need tactics for conflict management. key point steps call for emotional inoculation  exploration of the effects of bad outcomes  and precautionary corrective action points that prepare stakeholders for possible setbacks.,decision
Unstructured Decisions: This type of decision situation is complex and no standard solutions exist for resolving the situation. Some or all of the structural elements of the decision situation are undefined  ill-defined or unknown. For example  goals may be poorly defined  alternatives may be incomplete or non-comparable  choice criteria may be hard to measure or difficult to link to goals.,decision
Unstructured opportunities: Opportunities that are vague because key point events needed to produce favorable outcomes are uncertain.,decision
Unstructured problems: Problems that are poorly understood because most of their component parts are unknown or contentious.,decision
Utility: In economics  utility means the real or fancied ability of a good or service to satisfy a human want. An associated term is welfare function (synonym: utility function--not to be confused with utility function in decision theory; see below)  which relates the utility derived by an individual or group to the goods and services that it consumes. Marginal utility is the change in utility due to a one unit change in the quantity of a good or service consumed. ,decision
In decision theory  utility is a measure of the desirability of consequences of courses of action point that applies to decision making under risk--that is  under uncertainty with known probabilities. ,decision
Utility theory provides a basis for the assignment of utilities to consequences. There exist various methods for constructing utility functions. The best-known method is based on indifference judgments of the decision maker about specially constructed alternatives (lotteries). ,decision
It is the usefulness or the value  that is an attribute denoting the capacity to satisfy human desires  usually measured by the price someone is willing to pay. Marginal utility is the change in utility due to a one-unit change in the quantity consumed.,decision
The relationship between value and changes in the level of a criterion  such as increases in satisfaction point.,decision
Valuation information: Criteria  such as cost or profit  used to determine the merit of alternatives so that those with the greatest merit can be selected.,decision
Value: The determination of how much something is worth. If the item being valued is publicly traded  value can be observed in the market. For most real assets  it is not the case and we need to apply valuation techniques to impute a value.,decision
Value can be either objective or subjective. In the latter case  it means subjective worth or importance. For example the value of future benefits to the decision maker the value of clean air to the society." For the purposes of analysis  the subjective values must be measured on some scale. These measures of value should be based on preferences expressed by the person or group of interest. ,decision
In value analysis  one considers that the value v is related to the physical or other objective measure y of a consequence by a subjectively defined value function so that v = f(y). ,decision
Values are the ideas we have about what is good and what is bad  and how things should be. Besides business objective  we have values about family relationships  about work relationships and about other personal and relationships issues. In decision making  values are expressed in terms of weights given to the criteria  either explicitly or implicitly. Implicit values are derived by examining several similar decisions and noting which criteria must have been emphasized for a series of choices to have been made.,decision
Variable: A variable or variable number is a unspecified quantity that may assume any one of a set of values ( i.e.  the range of a variable). Variables can be continuous or discontinuous and dependent and independent.,decision
Vividness: A characteristic of information that makes it memorable because of its emotional appeal  proximity  or seeming reality.,decision
Warrant: A basis for drawing a conclusion  such as statistical significance  mathematical proof  or agreement among experts.,decision
Welfare: Satisfaction point  happiness  good.,decision
What are models?,decision
Models are simplified constructions of more complex phenomena. Leggo models of vehicles or buildings are examples. Motorized vehicles are complicated assemblages of mechanical and chemical systems creating and transferring energy. A model allows us to build one  simply  and see if works. If it doesn’t  the model allows us to alter some properties  add some parts  replace others  and see if it works. Applied to the social and historical world  models allow us to construct on paper an historical situation or a social process or an historical-social process  and then see if it works. Examples abound. In fact  they are everyday occurrences in the academic world. In the field of history  for instance  historians write books about different periods of time in different places of space  and frequently describe a series of events  and then try to explain them. Their reconstructions and explanations are informal models  although their authors might only rarely understand that. They are not said to be models but the historian has  effectively  built a complex assemblage (a society)  and subjected it to certain pressures (added on parts)  and then suggested that it works  or worked  that way  i.e.  the way s/he said it worked.,decision
A model is a work of fiction. Some properties ascribed to objects in the model will be genuine properties of the objects modeled  but others will be merely properties of convenience.,decision
what-if questioning: The logical inquiry applied to examine assumptions about key point factors  such as product demand or level of risk inherent in seemingly viable alternatives.,decision
Analysis poses a paradox for decision makers. Directed toward using objectives to compare various ways to respond to core problems  it can offer many valuable insights. However  when analysis is used without this perspective  it can do more harm than good  inhibiting legitimate questions about the merit of current alternatives.,decision
Various kinds of rationality are expressed in decision rules. These rules illustrate ways to act out preferences that call for risk aversion  risk taking  satisficing  and the like. Decision rules capture the preferences  expressed as behavior  of some decision makers but can be suboptimal because they do not consider trade-offs  providing a compensatory decision rule. The maximum expected value or MEV  rule shows how simple computations can cut through the uncertainty that often leads to bad decisions and capture these trade-offs.,decision
what-if questioning that relies on sensitivity analysis provides one way to relax assumptions about future conditions to identify conditions that favor an alternative. When key point assumptions about demand are relaxed  risks in the decision become clear. Sensitivity analysis can also be used to estimate the magnitude of unknown payoffs  such as the magnitude of possible litigation costs that prompt the adoption of several precautionary measures  such as insurance.,decision
X-Efficiency / X-Inefficiency: Managers are merely x-efficient due  to (1) selective rationality; (2) individual inadequacies; (3) discretionary effort; (4) pervasive inertia; (5) organizational entropy,decision
Zero sum game: A game in which the payoffs to the players add up to zero  so that a gain for one is necessarily equaled by loss to others. It contrasts with positive sum game. Zero-sum games or situations are situations in which the only way one side can get ahead (or get more of something) is if the other side gets less. This occurs when there is a finite amount of a resource to be distributed  and the together the parties want more than is available. In this situation  no side can get what they want unless the other side gets less than they want. This is also referred to as win-lose situations.,decision

So by learning just one English word  you can often end up adding two—or more—to your vocabulary!,ignore
For example  a crane can be a bird with long legs or a tall machine that helps lift heavy objects.,ignore
If you use it as a verb  you might be craning your neck (stretching it) to see something.,ignore
There are other ways that words can take on multiple meanings  though.,ignore
One of these ways involves phrasal verbs.,ingore
Phrasal verbs open up a whole new world of possibilities for speaking English. They are phrases that give verbs completely different meanings. They are also used incredibly often in everyday conversation  which makes them important to know.,ignore
For example  with phrasal verbs  when your kitten comes across (finds) your paper cranes and makes one fall down (drop)  you can either shout “Cut it out!” to make him stop  or you can give in and let your kitten play with the paper crafts.,key points
See how useful they are? You probably already know the verbs “come ” “fall ” “cut” and “give ” but the four bold phrasal verbs above might be new.,ignore
So come on  Let us learn some phrasal verbs.,ignore
A phrasal verb is a phrase that’s made up of a verb and another word or two  usually a preposition but sometimes an adverb.,ignore
So before we can talk about phrasal verbs  it’s important to understand what verbs  prepositions and adverbs are.,ignore
A verb is an action word. It describes something happening (i.e. hearing  seeing)  a state of being (i.e. to live  to sleep)  or an action being done (i.e. to read  to sing).,action point
A preposition is a word that describes the relationship between two words. For example  the bees are above the table or under the table  but not inside the table (hopefully). Prepositions mainly deal with location or direction (i.e. on  through  around) and time (i.e. “by” or “around” a certain time).,key point
An adverb is a word that describes a verb. For example  you can run quickly or slowly and arrive to class early or late.,action point
Now that you know what verbs and prepositions are  you were ready to start putting them together into phrasal verbs.,ignore
Phrasal verbs work by changing the verb’s meaning based on the preposition that follows them.,ignore
It’s easier than you think—you probably already know a number of phrasal verbs. For example  read the last sentence before this section: “So come on  Let us learn some phrasal verbs.” The words “come on” in that sentence are a phrasal verb!,ignore
The word “come ” on its own  means to move towards something. Together with the preposition “on ” though  the phrase “come on” becomes a phrase of encouragement.,ignore
There are many other phrasal verbs out there!,ignore
How to Learn Phrasal Verbs,ignore
English phrasal verbs are everywhere  so one of the best ways to learn them is to try to listen for them. These phrases are commonly used  and would not be unusual to hear in a conversation. Do you hear a verb used together with another word very often? It might be a phrasal verb.,ignore
If you were not sure whether a phrase is a phrasal verb or just a verb that happened to be spoken with a preposition  try looking it up. Most dictionaries have entries for phrasal verbs  so look the phrase up to be sure. You can also look up the phrase in the English Page phrasal dictionary which is an excellent resource  so save that link!,ignore
Some phrasal verb meanings are obvious—like “fall down”—but some are almost like idioms since they can’t be literally translated—like “come on.” To make them easier to learn  you can try grouping phrasal verbs into categories like time of day (i.e. wake up  lie down) or positive (i.e. cheer up) and negative (i.e. give up).,ignore
There are so many phrasal verbs that it might seem difficult to learn them all. But many of these phrases become natural after a while—all it takes is some repetition and practice.,ignore
How to Use Phrasal Verbs in English,ignore
Phrasal verbs are used just like verbs—anywhere they make sense!,ignore
Usually  the verb and preposition in a phrasal verb need to be said together  like in the phrase “fall down.” In some cases  though  you can separate the verb and the preposition by putting other words in between them.,ignore
For example: the phrase “turn off” can be used just like that  or it can be interrupted by stating what you were turning off. In other words  you can say “turn off the TV ” but you can also say “turn the TV off.” Both are correct!,ignore
Another thing to keep in mind about phrasal verbs is that they are still verbs. That means the verb part of the phrase can be changed depending on the tense of the sentence. So “turn off” can also be “turned off” and “turning off ” for example.,ignore
Bring it on! — To accept a challenge with confidence.,ignore

“Even though Samantha was in the last place  her brother cheeredher on through the entire race.”,key point
Cheer up — This phrase can either be used as a phrase of encouragement said to someone who seems sad (just saying “cheer up!” to them)  or it can mean to try to make someone happier.,key point
“Andrew was having a bad day  so his girlfriend cheered him up by taking him out for ice cream.”,key point
